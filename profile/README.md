# Abydon is coding lifestyle, browser games, AI tools, & dev-ops stuff as a hobby @ [IdleInteractive](https://www.IdleInteractive.com)

This account is for related open sourced projects.

Do not expect quality code, code reviews to be regular, or revisions to pull requests to be timely.

As this is intended to be a chill, relaxing hobby account, I simply do not have the time to perform to my usual professional standard. 

I just want to relax and code things.
