# Payment and License Terms

1) You agree that you have less than $200,000 USD in gross revenue (or personal income) and are not required to pay for a license for any of our projects, including stable/enterprise releases. It is to be assessed from January 1 of a given year to the end of December in the same year. Also known as a calendar year. This license automatically expires on January 31st each year and you must confirm your previous year's income is below this threshold to continue using the software under this licensing option.

2) If you (or the entity you work for) exceeds $200,000 USD in gross revenue (or personal income) you are required to pay for a license to use the stable and/or enterprise release branches. The amount in USD is per year. It is to be assessed from January 1 of a given year to the end of December in the same year. Also known as a calendar year.

3) The $200,000 USD figure is based on the DEC/2023 value for USD. Please refer to official CPI numbers to adjust this threshold for the current year via an official government source such as the BLS calculator: https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl or from the Federal Reserve such as: https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator

4) For those above the free licensing threshold, you are expected to purchase a license from Abydon and/or IdleInteractive. Such a license entitles you to use and modify the software (and related git repository contents) for all stable and/or enteprise tagged releases during your license term.

5) You may make full use of your version of the software for the duration of the license you have been granted. This includes providing it in the form of a portion (or the entirety of) a software-as-a-service product. It also includes making any modifications you wish to your copy of the git repository.

6) If you choose to redistribute the source code from the stable and/or enteprise portions of the repository, you agree to do so as part of a public repository operating under the most recent licensing terms and contrbutor agreements that are present in that release of the software.

The purpose of this section is to allow you to contribute solutions to various issues with that release so they can be corrected for the benefit of all users of this repository.
