# Code of Conduct

* Don't be a bigger asshole than Abydon or require us to come up with more rules we need to enforce.
    * I have my bad days and days I forget the person I want to be.
    * I have health issues that can result in me being irritable. It is never personal, it is just me having a bad day.
        * Even with the medications I take, simply medicating a problem is rarely a complete solution.
    * If I have a bad day, just remind me I'm being a dick. Thanks and I'll try to come back later when I'm not feeling like shit.

* Try to make this a positive and inclusive environment.
    * Do not violate people's privacy and/or psuedononymous nature.
    * Do not add data collection to our projects beyonded what is needed for moderation and anonymized analytics.
    * Do not engage in anti-social behavior, such as trolling and meme commits.

* We have standardized on English for moderation and the maintainer's sanity, not everyone is fluent. 
    * Please assume best intentions when it comes to miscommunications from such things.
    * What may be normal in your culture may be rude in theirs, also vice versa. Try to consider the human being behind the screen.

* Do not bring up controversial topics that would cause issues with your typical HR rules. (That means no politics, religion, sex, etc.)

* We are a gender, race, and other protected category neutral set of repositories.
    * We are not intereted in your gender (at birth or trans or non-binary or whatever gets added later), your race, your sexuality, and so forth.
    * Anyone bringing up these topics in our repositories is not welcome. That includes people intentionally misgendering people after a pronoun issue is discussed.
    * The goal is to simply not know your status (or my status or anyone's status really) of your party affiliation, religious affiliation, gender identity, or anything that results in arguments we cannot solve with the projects being worked on here. 
    * I'd like to fix the world, it just is far beyond my power level. So I'm gonna just avoid complicating these projects with real life baggage.
    * Ideally you contribute under a psuedonym on these projects so we do not know your details in these classes.
        * Similarly, I'm gonna try to avoid voice channels / voice calls in these projects.
        * Text and screenshots with annotation should be enough to solve most issues. It also works better for an async communication environment.

* This code of conduct applies to any portion of our community, whether it is on github or any other official project spaces.
    * I'm not here to police the internet but if you start using a racial slur in one of my discord servers, I'll still boot you from GitHub.
    * What people do on spaces we are not involved in aren't my concern.
    * I'm not interested in witch hunting users across platforms with limited evidence. 
    * It needs to be 100% clear to EVERYONE that this person is the same one on multiple platforms.
