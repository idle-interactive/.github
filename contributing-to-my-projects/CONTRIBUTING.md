# Communication

* Communication is largely going to be asynchronous and based on free time/hobby time availability so expect long wait times between replies.

# How to Contribute

* Read PULL-REQUESTS.md so you know what we are looking for in a pull request as well as who to contact to confirm what you have in mind is viable for acceptance.
* Read the licensing files and contributor agreement so you are aware of the social contract that governs the project.
* Realize this is not a "serious" project with full time maintainers / contributors / backed by a corporation with real resources. As such, things are going to move slowly and based on people's free time which might be 0 some months.

# Security related pull requests

* Please use a private and/or local repository to develop your fix to avoid bad actors exploiting it during development.
* Please ping the project maintainer to get their attention and invite them to the private repo so it can be reviewed privately.
* Once its ready to commit, please create the public pull request and ping the maintainer so it can be merged and released ASAP to minimize the window of vulnerability.
* Any software vulnerability, other than information disclosure of non-private data (user data, configuration details would fall under private data), pretty much any demonstratable exploit does not require previous contact and will be merged as long as it doesn't completely break things in terms of implementation.
    * It is assumed you won't implement breaking changes as part of a security update. If you are, we might be better just turning the functionality off termporarily until a fully working version of the feature with security related fixes are completed.

# Contacting the Maintainer

* Right now, I'm mainly available via Discord and E-mail <abydon@idleinteractive.com>.
    * https://www.idleinteractive.com/pages/about/ should have a working link to the discord community and other contact points.
    * I have *very* aggressive spam filtering on the idleinteractive.com domain for this address so if it ends up in SPAM or I'm taking a week to reply, contact me via Discord.
    * IRC is currently a backup method in the event of issues with Discord and should only be used if the Discord service is down.
