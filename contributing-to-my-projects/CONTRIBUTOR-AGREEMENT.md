## Fiduciary License Agreement 2.0

## Human Summary

The intention is to shorten our ability to maintain control to a reasonable length, enable the commercial licensing of our projects, as well as providing the community with the ability to make use of the project on their own infrastructure if desired.

Based off of: https://contributoragreements.org/

We will try to maintain a version of this CLA in our git repos for versioning purposes as well as on github and idleinteractive.com

Exact links / e-mails may get broken from time to time and the version included in the repository at the time of the pull request or commit should be considered the binding / authoritative version.

That said, we reserve the right to update this agreement and after each update if you continue to contribute pull requests or other actions within that project's git repo it is assumed you have agreeded to such an update as well as applying that version of the agreement to all historical changes you have contributed.

Generally, this agreement is signed by simply stating that you agree to the CONTRIBUTOR-AGREEMENT.md terms as part of your commit with a psuedonym and/or real name as well as a valid e-mail address at which we can contact you at. This allows everyone in possession of our project repositories to have a valid record of the people who stated they are responsible for a given contribution.

## Individual Contributor Exclusive License Agreement

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Abydon and/or Idle Interactive's public git repositories ("We" or "Us").

The purpose of this contributor agreement ("Agreement") is to clarify and document the rights granted by contributors to Us. To make this document effective, please follow the instructions and please note in the git log of your pull request that you have agreed to the CLA.

### 0\. Preamble

Software is deeply embedded in all aspects of our lives and it is important that it empower, rather than restrict us. Free Software gives everybody the rights to use, understand, adapt and share software. These rights help support other fundamental freedoms like freedom of speech, press and privacy.

Development of Free Software can follow many patterns. In some cases whole development is handled by a sole programmer or a small group of people. But usually, the creation and maintenance of software is a complex process that requires the contribution of many individuals. This also affects who owns the rights to the software. In the latter case, rights in software are owned jointly by a great number of individuals.

To tackle this issue some projects require a full copyright assignment to be signed by all contributors. The problem with such assignments is that they often lack checks and balances that would protect the contributors from potential abuse of power from the new copyright holder.

FSFE’s Fiduciary License Agreement (FLA) was created by the Free Software Foundation Europe e.V. with just that in mind – to concentrate all deciding power within one entity and prevent fragmentation of rights on one hand, while on the other preventing that single entity from abusing its power. The main aim is to ensure that the software covered under the FLA will forever remain Free Software.

This process only serves for the transfer of economic rights. So-called moral rights (e.g. authors right to be identified as author) remain with the original author(s) and are inalienable.

### How to use this FLA

If You are an employee and have created the Contribution as part of your employment, You need to have Your employer approve this Agreement or sign the Entity version of this document. If You do not own the Copyright in the entire work of authorship, any other author of the Contribution should also sign this – in any event, please contact us via the contact points on the idleinteractive.com website or at abydon@idleinteractive.com

### 1\. Definitions

**"You"** means the individual Copyright owner who Submits a Contribution to Us.

**"Legal Entity"** means an entity that is not a natural person.

**"Affiliate"** means any other Legal Entity that controls, is controlled by, or under common control with that Legal Entity. For the purposes of this definition, "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such Legal Entity, whether by contract or otherwise, (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding shares or securities that vote to elect the management or other persons who direct such Legal Entity or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

**"Contribution"** means any original work of authorship, including any original modifications or additions to an existing work of authorship, Submitted by You to Us, in which You own the Copyright.

**"Copyright"** means all rights protecting works of authorship, including copyright, moral and neighboring rights, as appropriate, for the full term of their existence.

**"Material"** means the software or documentation made available by Us to third parties. When this Agreement covers more than one software project, the Material means the software or documentation to which the Contribution was Submitted. After You Submit the Contribution, it may be included in the Material.

**"Submit"** means any act by which a Contribution is transferred to Us by You by means of tangible or intangible media, including but not limited to electronic mailing lists, source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, Us, but excluding any transfer that is conspicuously marked or otherwise designated in writing by You as "Not a Contribution."

**"Documentation"** means any non-software portion of a Contribution.

### 2\. License grant

#### 2.1 Copyright license to Us

#### 2.2 Moral rights

Moral Rights remain unaffected to the extent they are recognized and not waivable by applicable law. Notwithstanding, You may add your name to the attribution mechanism customary used in the Materials you Contribute to, which in this case is the git log author data.

#### 2.3 Copyright license back to You

Upon such grant of rights to Us, We immediately grant to You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, under the Copyright covering the Contribution to use the Contribution by all means, including, but not limited to:

This license back is limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights to the material submitted by other contributors.

### 3\. Patents

#### 3.1 Patent license

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement You hereby grant to Us and to recipients of Materials distributed by Us a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual and irrevocable (except as stated in Section 3.2) patent license, with the right to transfer an unlimited number of non-exclusive licenses or to grant sublicenses to third parties, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the Contribution and the Contribution in combination with any Material (and portions of such combination). This license applies to all patents owned or controlled by You, whether already acquired or hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by making, having made, using, selling, offering for sale, importing or otherwise transferring of Your Contribution(s) alone or by combination of Your Contribution(s) with any Material.

#### 3.2 Revocation of patent license

You reserve the right to revoke the patent license stated in section 3.1 if We make any infringement claim that is targeted at your Contribution and not asserted for a Defensive Purpose. An assertion of claims of the Patents shall be considered for a "Defensive Purpose" if the claims are asserted against an entity that has filed, maintained, threatened, or voluntarily participated in a patent infringement lawsuit against Us or any of Our licensees.

### 4\. License obligations by Us

We agree to license patents owned or controlled by You only to the extent necessary to (sub)license Your Contribution(s) and the combination of Your Contribution(s) with the Material under the terms of the licenses below. You agree to license such patents for $0 USD.

More specifically and in strict accordance with the above paragraph, we agree to (sub)license the Contribution or any Materials containing, based on or derived from the Contribution only in accordance with our licensing policy:

##### Vendor libraries, directories, and other 3rd party code

Code and other copyrighted material covered added by automated library installers (such as composer, npm, and so forth) may be included in various portions of the branches (such as the vendor directory). It is your responsibility to validate the legal implications of such code and if their licenses are compatible with your use case and needs.

Code other material from such sources are NOT created by us or our contributors and we have no ability to re-license such materials added from 3rd party sources such as composer repositories of other open source projects.

##### All code contained in the development/master/main branches, and the commits contained in these portions of the repo are covered under the MIT License:

Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”), to deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

##### Enterprise/Stable Release Licensing
Certain branches will be labeled with prefixes (or whole branch names) such as "stable-release-", "stable-development", "stable-main", "stable-master", or really any branch/commit with the "stable" label. They also will be tagged as something like "stable-release-" instead of "community-release-" to differentiate which releases are which. Some of these branches might also be labeled "enterprise-" instead of "stable-".

You agree that while we provide this code as part of the public repo, such code is covered under a different licensing agreement and that your contributions may be used as part of such branches/releases under a production ready license intended for buisnesses and enterprises that want a battle-tested end product with extra care toward stability, security, performance, as well as certain features/tooling/etc we feel are not needed in the community edition.

Technically, nothing physically stops anyone from simply downloading our stable-release versions that we have tested in production with our own users (internally and/or externally). That said, you would be in violation of the license if you do this before 18 months after the release date.

The Enterprise/Stable release licensing changes are as follows:

1) You agree that you have less than $200,000 USD in gross revenue (or personal income) and are not required to pay for a license for any of our projects, including stable/enterprise releases. The amount in USD is per year, to be assessed from January 1 of a given year to the end of December in the same year. Also known as a calendar year.

2) If you (or the entity you work for) exceeds $200,000 USD in gross revenue (or personal income) you are required to pay for a license to use the stable and/or enterprise release branches. The exact terms for this license will be noted in the project's STABLE-LICENSE.md or ENTERPRISE-LICENSE.md file. The amount in USD is per year, to be assessed from January 1 of a given year to the end of December in the same year. Also known as a calendar year.

3) The $200,000 USD figure is based on the DEC/2023 value for USD. Please refer to official CPI numbers to adjust this threshold for the current year via an official government source such as the BLS calculator: https://data.bls.gov/cgi-bin/cpicalc.pl or from the Federal Reserve such as: https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator

4) All contributors agree we (Abydon and/or IdleInteractive) may modify the exact terms in the STABLE-LICENSE.md or ENTERPRISE-LICENSE.md however we want in line with this section of the agreement. Such modifications in present or future cannot remove the automatic re-licensing section of this agreement, the maximum delay of 18 months for any licensing of "enterprise" or "stable" contributions, or the fact that the community branches and/or releases will be MIT licensed.

5) The intention is to provide better tested versions of the code that IdleInteractive and/or Abydon has tested (via their internal processes, infrastructure and/or customers utilizing their projects) as well as providing a list of financial contributors for determining prioritization of issues/feedback.

That said the stable/enterprise licenses always will have this disclaimer:

THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED “AS IS”, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.

###### Automatic re-licensing of all code in the repository

In addition, any code older than 18 months in any Abydon or IdleInteractive public repository (regardless of original licensing status that is contributed by Us or any contributor to this agreement) is automatically re-licensed under the MIT License above. It is this portion of how we license our code that causes us to keep all code in public repositories as it allows the community, customers, or anyone else to takeover the projects (or features of those projects or anything in them really).

Our goal is not to permanently encumber code intended for business use but instead provide a balance in terms of commercial viability of our projects while allowing the community to get full use of our work within a reasonable amount of time.

This is not intended to withhold security or stability improvements to community-releases. If you notice such a fix in one of our enterprise or stable branches that is critical to the security or stability of the project's software, please, open a pull request with just the relevant code so it can be committed to the community branch. We are all human and I know I personally make alot of mistakes.

### 5. Disclaimer

THE CONTRIBUTION IS PROVIDED "AS IS". MORE PARTICULARLY, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMED BY YOU TO US AND BY US TO YOU. TO THE EXTENT THAT ANY SUCH WARRANTIES CANNOT BE DISCLAIMED, SUCH WARRANTY IS LIMITED IN DURATION AND EXTENT TO THE MINIMUM PERIOD AND EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

### 6. Consequential damage waiver

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL YOU OR WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF ANTICIPATED SAVINGS, LOSS OF DATA, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL AND EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT REGARDLESS OF THE LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY (CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) UPON WHICH THE CLAIM IS BASED.

### 7. Approximation of disclaimer and damage waiver

IF THE DISCLAIMER AND DAMAGE WAIVER MENTIONED IN SECTION 5. AND SECTION 6. CANNOT BE GIVEN LEGAL EFFECT UNDER APPLICABLE LOCAL LAW, REVIEWING COURTS SHALL APPLY LOCAL LAW THAT MOST CLOSELY APPROXIMATES AN ABSOLUTE WAIVER OF ALL CIVIL OR CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONTRIBUTION.

### 8. Term

8.1 This Agreement shall come into effect upon Your acceptance of the terms and conditions.

8.2 This Agreement shall apply for the term of the copyright and patents licensed here. However, You shall have the right to terminate the Agreement if We do not fulfill the obligations as set forth in Section 4. Such termination must be made in writing.

8.3 In the event of a termination of this Agreement Sections 5., 6., 7., 8., and 9. shall survive such termination and shall remain in full force thereafter. For the avoidance of doubt, Free and Open Source Software (sub)licenses that have already been granted for Contributions at the date of the termination shall remain in full force after the termination of this Agreement.

### 9. Miscellaneous

9.1 This Agreement and all disputes, claims, actions, suits or other proceedings arising out of this agreement or relating in any way to it shall be governed by the laws of Richmond, Virginia, United States excluding its private international law provisions.

9.2 This Agreement sets out the entire agreement between You and Us for Your Contributions to Us and overrides all other agreements or understandings.

9.3 In case of Your death, this agreement shall continue with Your heirs. In case of more than one heir, all heirs must exercise their rights through a commonly authorized person.

9.4 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the original provision and that is enforceable. The terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement shall apply notwithstanding any failure of essential purpose of this Agreement or any limited remedy to the maximum extent possible under law.

9.5 You agree to notify Us of any facts or circumstances of which you become aware that would make this Agreement inaccurate in any respect.

### 10. Contributions on Behalf or By Legal Entities

10.1 If you are contributing on behalf of a corporation (or other legal entity other than an individual), you agree that you are authorized to sign this agreement in accordance with whatever internal controls they have implemented.

10.2 You agree to include the name of corporation (or other legal entity other than an indvidual) responsible for this contribution in the git log for posterity as well as the person or people that signed off on this commit as required by law, your emploment agreement, and any other obligations you might have.


### 11. Signing this agreement and storage of signatures

11.1 The intention is for agreement to be signed in the git log with appropriate name (or psuedonym) plus a contact e-mail. All copies of the repo should retain this information so in the event of dispute, the appropriate person can be contacted. It also provides a distributed form of evidence of who claimed to have signed this agreement as well as had the authority to perform the related assignments of intellectual property.

11.2 You agree that a statement at any point in the git log under your name and/or e-mail is sufficient to cover both past, present, and future commits you might make under this agreement. In addition, any commit under your identity (or psuedonym) after a change in this contributor agreement is considered acceptance of the current version of this agreement in that version of the repository and it is your responsibility to use tools such as "git blame contributor-agreement.md" to examine any changes in the agreement before submitting your contributions.
